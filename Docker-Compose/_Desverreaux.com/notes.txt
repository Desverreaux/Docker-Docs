There are various things that need to be done from within the container after it is created. 
Eventually these actions can be written into a bash script and executed automatically,
there are currently some issues with this approuch so they will have to be done manually.

[DONE][this at least needs to be done] --- remove the line " include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*; " from 'etc/nginx/nginx.conf'
[DONE][line above is obsolete once this change is incorporated] --- replace '/etc/nginx/nginx.conf' with 'C:/data/conf.d/ngixn.conf'  

--- start the following services
====== nginx
====== php7.2-fpm 

execute: composer global require laravel/installer 
execute: export PATH=$PATH:~/.composer/vendor/bin

--- add the line 
------ "export PATH=$PATH:~/.composer/vendor/bin"
------ to "~/.bashrc"

execute: mkdir /var/www_temp/
execute: cd /var/www_temp/
execute: laravel new blog

--- from within the server root directory execute 
------ chown -R www-data ./bootstrap/cache
------ chown -R www-data ./storage
------ chown -R www-data ./public
------ cp .env.example .env
------ php artisan key:generate

#!bin/bash
